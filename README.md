This is the website of Trondheim Bike Kitchen / Trondheim sykkelkjÃ¸kken.

You can find it here: **https://sykkelkjokken.no**

This is a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Setup

1. Install a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Develop

Start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab:

```sh
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Build

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
