Our members help each other learn how to repair our own bicycles, and we provide access to a wide range of tools. Everyone is welcome to become a member or a volunteer, regardless of bicycle repair skill. Our goal is to make cycling available to all of Trondheim, to spread cycling knowledge and joy, and to encourage enivironmentally friendly transport.",
    "title2": "What we do",
    "text2": "At the bike kitchen you can learn more about repairing bikes and meet other people who are interested in cycling, repairing and green mobility. Our workshop is open on Wednesdays from 17-20h, and occasionally we also host other bike related events.",
    "title3": "Tools",
    "text3": "Bike tools can be expensive, and often you'll only need them once. By becoming a member, for the price of a tool, you get access to all our tools, and our knowledgable members. Our workshop located at BÃ¸ker & Bylab is well stocked with most tools needed for both maintenance and repair, as well as consumeables such as inner tubes, brake pads, grease and cleaning supplies."
