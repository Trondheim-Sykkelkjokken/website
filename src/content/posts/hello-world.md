We have a webpage! As every cool organization should! While most of our activity will be found on Facebook, we think it's important to have a place to follow us that is not controlled by big tech in [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley)Silicon Valley. How this site will be used, grow and evolve is uncertain, but it is a start. If you find any bugs, or you have any suggestions for us, please contact us at [trondheimsykkelkjokken@gmail.com](mailto:trondheimsykkelkjokken@gmail.com), or on our [github page](https://github.com/Trondheim-Sykkelkjokken/website).
