		<h1>Trondheim Bike Kitchen</h1>
		<p>
			Trondheim Bike Kitchen is a membership-based community bicycle workshop run by a group of
			volunteers. We help each other learn how to repair our own bicycles, and we provide access to
			a wide range of tools. Everyone is welcome to become a member or a volunteer, regardless of
			bicycle repair skill. Our goal is to make cycling available to all of Trondheim, to spread
			cycling knowledge and joy, and to encourage enivironmentally friendly transport.

		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<p>
			Bike tools can be expensive, and often you'll only need them once. By becoming a member, for
			the price of a tool, you get access to all our tools, and our knowledgable members. Our
			workshop located at BÃ¸ker & Bylab is well stocked with most tools needed for both maintenance
			and repair, as well as consumeables such as inner tubes, brake pads, grease and cleaning
			supplies.
