		<h1>Trondheim Bike Kitchen</h1>
		<p>
			Trondheim Bike Kitchen is a non-profit bike workshop. Here members get access to tools and
			guidance in how to repair their own bikes. "Bike kitchen" is an established concept for
			sharing knowledge and resources on bike repair and similar initiatives exist in countries all
			over the world. Our goal is to be a community for sharing knowledge about repairing and
			inspiration for cycling. We also wish to contribute to reduce resource consumption by giving
			bikes a longer life through repairs and good maintenance.
